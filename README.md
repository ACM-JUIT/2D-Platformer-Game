# 2D-Platformer-Game

A platformer type game in 2D, using Unity Engine and C#. 

##Overview

The project template comes with a scene in 2D containing a ground plane, a player gameobject with a movement script that enables it to move and jump. The objective would be to find a way towards the exit to end the level. The exit door will also contain a script which switches to the next scene (level). 

##Main Features

The objective is to create multiple scenes with unique *level designing*(including 2D GameObjects and Sprites) which would include certain puzzles to find a way to the end of a level; in order to make this a full fledged platformer. Furthermore, necessary components like **a start menu, and a pause menu, and other essential UI  should be added**.

##Additional Features

Moreover, the team can add interactable game objects such as a key (which is to be collected to open the exit door), collectibles such as coins, score, animations, lighting systems, post processing, etc. to further enhance the gameplay and visuals.
